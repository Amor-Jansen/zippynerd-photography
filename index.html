                <h3>About Us</h3>
                <p>            I am an aspiring photographer, I have a medical anomaly that changed the vision in my one eye. 
                    And as a result I see colours a little different from that eye, 
                    I believe that is what gives me a different view on ,well, everything. 
                    I try to find beauty in everything I can.
                    <br>
                    I really got into photography in 2020 during the covid lock-down. 
                    The full story is on the blog page. Be sure to check it out.
                    <br>
                    My favourite type of photography is macro. 
                    Although animal and people photography is close behind. 
                    The thing I love about macro is the ability to show a world which most people donâ€™t often get to see, 
                    small critters and flowers. There is always something beautiful.
                    <br>
                    My hope is that I will be able to do more People photography and build my portfolio.
                    Of course, also, providing beautiful memories to my customers.</p>
